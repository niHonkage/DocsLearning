# Welcome to FusionWorks

FusionWorks is an open-source large language model (LLM) application development platform. It combines the concepts of Backend-as-a-Service and LLMOps to enable developers to quickly build production-grade generative AI applications. Even non-technical personnel can participate in the definition and data operations of AI applications.

By integrating the key technology stacks required for building LLM applications, including support for hundreds of models, an intuitive Prompt orchestration interface, high-quality RAG engines, and a flexible Agent framework, while providing a set of easy-to-use interfaces and APIs, FusionWorks saves developers a lot of time reinventing the wheel, allowing them to focus on innovation and business needs.

### Why Use FusionWorks?

You can think of libraries like LangChain as toolboxes with hammers, nails, etc. In comparison, FusionWorks provides a more production-ready, complete solution - think of FusionWorks as a scaffolding system with refined engineering design and software testing.

<!-- Importantly, FusionWorks is **open source**, co-created by a professional full-time team and community.  -->
You can self-deploy capabilities similar to Assistants API and GPTs based on any model, maintaining full control over your data with flexible security, all on an easy-to-use interface.

<!-- > Our community users summarize their evaluation of FusionWorks's products as simple, restrained, and rapid iteration.
